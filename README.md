# Milestone Project 1

My first Milestone Project using what I've learnt from the HTML and CSS modules along with additional CSS from Bootstrap 4

## Fantastical Art Gallery

The idea for the project was to create a website for a fictional art gallery that contained the necessary information to engage visitors on the website. Information included a home page, an about page, pages showcasing previous, current and upcoming art shows, a link to an external blog, and a contact page complete with form.

## Additional

Created custom flyers / posters for the previous, current and upcoming art shows, in Adobe Photoshop, using existing artwork by artists Simone Bianchi, Shiori Matsumoto, Adam Oehlers and Frank Frazetta and overlaying text to make them look like actual gallery flyers for events.

## Tests

Tested the appearance of the website in Chrome, and used the Dev Tools to make sure it was also responsive for mobile and tablet.
