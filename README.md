# Milestone Project 1

My first Milestone Project using what I've learnt from the HTML and CSS modules along with additional CSS from Bootstrap 4

## Fantastical Art Gallery

The idea for the project was to create a website for a fictional art gallery that contained the necessary information to engage visitors to the website. Information included a home page, an about page, a page showcasing previous and current art shows, a link to an external blog, and a contact page complete with form.

## Additional

Created custom flyers / posters to represent previous and current art shows, in Affinity Photo software using existing artwork by artists Magali Villeneuve, Christina Angelina, Dan Dos Santos, Frank Frazetta, Michael Whelan, Simone Bianchi and Virgil Finlay.

## Features

### Home Page

A brief introduction to the fictional gallery. Also included on the page is the fictional bricks and mortar address as well as a sign up form to be added to a mailing list database.

### About Page

A page outlining what and who the fictional gallery does.

### Shows Page

A page that allows the user to see current and previous exhibitions with examples of the art from the shows

### Blog Link

A link in the menu that opens directly to a blog in a new tab in the browser the user is using.

### Contact Page

Includes an email form with name, email and comment fields. Also included on the page is the fictional bricks and mortar address as well as a sign up form to be added to a mailing list database.

## Tests

Tested the appearance of the website in Chrome and Firefox browsers using the Dev Tools to make sure it was responsive for mobile and tablet, and making sure all the images appeared correctly and the links worked.
